# 🧠 Predicting Problematic Internet Use from Physical Fitness Data

## 📌 About

In today’s digital age, problematic internet use among children and adolescents is a growing concern—often linked to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and reduced physical well-being. However, existing assessment methods are often complex, clinical, and inaccessible to many families.

This project, part of a Kaggle competition, proposes using **physical and fitness indicators** as **accessible proxies** to predict problematic internet use. These include posture, physical activity, and lifestyle habits—offering a practical solution in settings where clinical evaluation is not feasible.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Current tools for identifying internet overuse in youth are limited by cultural, linguistic, and professional barriers. In contrast, physical data is easy to collect and monitor.

The challenge:  
> Develop a predictive machine learning model using children’s physical activity and health data to detect early signs of problematic digital behavior.
